# TODO Activity

Somehow, "todo applications" are the most common example for teaching React. This activity will let you practice with `useState` to create a simple todo tracker.

To get started, run the command `npm install`, and then `npm start`. The development server should start, and your browser should open showing the handout code.

The goal of this activity is to enhance the starter code so that:
* The "Add TODO item" will add a new item to the list
* The "Delete" icon will delete an item from the list
* Add a "Delete all" button, that will delete all items from the list

After Module 8, you might also consider the following objective:
* After the list of todo items changes, display a [toast](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/toast) confirming that the todo list changed.
